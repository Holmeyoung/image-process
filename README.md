# Image process script

## [image_deduplicate](https://github.com/Holmeyoung/image-process/blob/master/image_deduplicate.py)

Use `phash` to judge whether two images are the same or not.

Use `Pigeon nest principle` to accelerate calculation.



## [image_valid](https://github.com/Holmeyoung/image-process/blob/master/image_valid.py)

Used to judge whether a image is valid or not. I use `multiprocess` to deal with it, so it's very fast.
